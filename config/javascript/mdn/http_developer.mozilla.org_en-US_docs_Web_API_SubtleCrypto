The <code><strong>SubtleCrypto</strong></code> interface of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</a> provides a number of low-level cryptographic functions. It is accessed via the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/subtle" title="The Crypto.subtle read-only property returns a SubtleCrypto object allowing to perform cryptographical operations."><code>Crypto.subtle</code></a> properties available in a window context (via <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/crypto" title="The Window.crypto property returns the Crypto object associated to the global object. This object allows web pages access to certain cryptographic related services. Although the Window.crypto property iteself is read-only, all of its methods (and the methods of its child object, SubtleCrypto) are not read-only, and therefore vulnerable to attack by polyfill."><code>Window.crypto</code></a>).
