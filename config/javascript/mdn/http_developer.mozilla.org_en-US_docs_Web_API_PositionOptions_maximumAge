The <code><strong>PositionOptions.maximumAge</strong></code> property is a positive <code>long</code> value indicating the maximum age in milliseconds of a possible cached position that is acceptable to return. If set to <code>0</code>, it means that the device cannot use a cached position and must attempt to retrieve the real current position. If set to <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity">Infinity</a></code> the device must return a cached position regardless of its age.
